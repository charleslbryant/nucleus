# Task Logs

## Purpose
Task logs track the progress of all implementation tasks for Nucleus. They provide a daily record of work, organized by task status, and are linked to CRDs and PRDs for traceability.

## Structure
- Each task log is a markdown file named by date (e.g., `tasklog-YYYY-MM-DD.md`).
- Tasks are grouped by status: In Progress, On Hold, To Do, Done, Cancelled.
- Task logs are updated daily as work progresses.

## Usage
- Create a new task log for each day, copying over any unfinished tasks from the previous log.
- Update task status as work progresses.
- Link tasks to CRDs and PRDs for context.

## Directory Structure
- `tasks/` — All daily task logs
- `../roadmap/change-requests/` — CRDs for active features
