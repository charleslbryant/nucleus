# Issue #123: Production Deployment Configuration

## Overview
Configure and deploy Nucleus to production environment with proper authentication, monitoring, and security settings.

## Linked PRD
- [Production Deployment](../roadmap/product-requirements/PRD-production-deployment.md)
- **Parent PRD**: [Production Deployment](#103)

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Configure production environment (Docker, Kubernetes, or cloud platform)
- [ ] Set up authentication and authorization system
- [ ] Implement application monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Configure production security settings
- [ ] Optimize for production load and performance
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline for automated deployments
- [ ] Configure production database with proper backups
- [ ] Implement logging and error tracking
- [ ] Set up SSL/TLS certificates
- [ ] Configure environment-specific settings

## Implementation Tasks
### In Progress
- [ ] Production deployment configuration
- [ ] Set up authentication system

### To Do
- [ ] Configure production environment
- [ ] Add user roles and permissions
- [ ] Implement monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Configure production database
- [ ] Implement security hardening
- [ ] Set up SSL/TLS certificates
- [ ] Configure logging and error tracking
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Load testing and validation

## Dependencies
- Admin Dashboard Implementation (#122)
- Authentication System (#124)

## Notes
- Current development environment is stable and ready for production
- Need to decide on deployment platform (Docker, Kubernetes, Azure, AWS, etc.)
- Authentication system needs to be implemented before production deployment
- Monitoring and alerting are critical for production reliability
