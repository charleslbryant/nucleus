# Issue #100: Nucleus Evaluate API Endpoint

## Overview
A single API endpoint (`/api/evaluate`) for capturing, logging, and evaluating AI executions from external systems (n8n, Make, Power Automate, enterprise systems). Built to fine-tune AI for AgenticOps workflows.

## Jobs-to-be-Done
- **AI Engineers**: Need to evaluate AI outputs automatically
- **Operators and Operations Teams**: Want to monitor AI node quality
- **Business Users**: Want reliable, high-quality AI solutions

## User Journey
1. User configures an Agentic workflow with digital, data, IoT, and AI nodes
2. Agentic workflow sends output to `/api/evaluate`
3. Nucleus logs the execution and evaluates output using LLM
4. If score is low, triggers human feedback
5. User reviews results in dashboard

## Requirements
- [x] Accept POST requests with workflow execution data
- [x] Log all executions with internal PKs and external refs
- [x] Evaluate output using OpenAI GPT
- [x] Trigger human feedback if score < threshold
- [x] Return evaluation result in response
- [x] Support multi-platform integration

## Success Criteria
- [x] 100% of executions logged and evaluated
- [x] Human feedback triggered only when needed
- [x] Integration with n8n, Make, Power Automate
- [x] API uptime > 99.9%

## Dependencies & Risks
- **Dependencies**: OpenAI API reliability, Schema compatibility with multiple platforms
- **Risks**: OpenAI API rate limits, Platform-specific integration challenges
- **Assumptions**: External platforms can make HTTP POST requests

## Roadmap Priority
- **Priority**: High
- **Timeline**: Phase 1 (Foundation)
- **Phase**: Phase 1

## Implementation Status
- ✅ **COMPLETED**: Core API endpoint implemented
- ✅ **COMPLETED**: LLM integration with OpenAI
- ✅ **COMPLETED**: Human feedback system
- ✅ **COMPLETED**: Multi-platform support
