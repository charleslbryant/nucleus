# GitHub Issues Traceability Matrix

## Overview
This matrix shows the complete traceability chain from Product Requirements Documents (PRDs) through Change Request Documents (CRDs) to implementation tasks and personal work.

## Issue Hierarchy

### Level 1: Product Requirements (PRDs)
High-level product requirements that define what users need and why.

| Issue | Title | Status | Phase |
|-------|-------|--------|-------|
| #100 | Nucleus Evaluate API Endpoint | ✅ Completed | Phase 1 |
| #101 | n8n Workflow Integration | ✅ Completed | Phase 2 |
| #102 | Admin Dashboard | ✅ Completed | Phase 3 |
| #103 | Production Deployment | ⏳ In Progress | Phase 4 |

### Level 2: Change Requests (CRDs)
Implementation plans that define how to build the features.

| Issue | Title | Parent PRD | Status | Phase |
|-------|-------|------------|--------|-------|
| #121 | Human Feedback System | #100 | ✅ Completed | Phase 2 |
| #122 | Admin Dashboard Implementation | #102 | ✅ Completed | Phase 3 |
| #123 | Production Deployment Configuration | #103 | ⏳ In Progress | Phase 4 |
| #124 | Authentication System | #103 | ⏳ In Progress | Phase 4 |

### Level 3: Personal Tasks
Individual tasks linked to CRDs for personal work tracking.

| Issue | Title | Parent CRD | Assignee | Status |
|-------|-------|------------|----------|--------|
| #125 | Advanced Analytics | #122 | charl | On Hold |
| #126 | n8n Integration Testing | #101 | charl | To Do |
| #127 | Real-time Updates | #122 | charl | To Do |
| #128 | Advanced Filtering | #122 | charl | To Do |

## Labels and Organization

### PRD Labels
- `prd` - Product Requirements Document
- `requirement` - High-level requirement
- `product` - Product-level issue
- `phase-1/2/3/4` - Development phase

### CRD Labels
- `epic` - Major feature implementation
- `crd` - Change Request Document
- `phase-1/2/3/4` - Development phase
- `frontend/backend/infrastructure` - Technical area

### Personal Task Labels
- `task` - Individual task
- `personal` - Personal work tracking
- `high-priority/medium-priority/low-priority` - Priority level

## Benefits of This Structure

### Complete Traceability
- **PRD → CRD → Personal Task**: Full chain from requirements to implementation
- **Bidirectional Links**: Navigate from personal work back to requirements
- **Status Tracking**: See progress at every level

### Team Collaboration
- **Clear Ownership**: Each level has appropriate assignees
- **Dependency Management**: Understand what blocks what
- **Progress Visibility**: See status across all levels

### Documentation Integration
- **GitHub Issues**: Team-level tracking and collaboration
- **Personal Tasklogs**: Individual work tracking
- **Memory Bank**: Project context and decisions
- **CRDs/PRDs**: Detailed documentation

## Usage Guidelines

### Creating New Features
1. **Start with PRD**: Create GitHub Issue using PRD template
2. **Create CRD**: Create GitHub Issue using CRD Epic template
3. **Link Them**: Reference PRD in CRD issue
4. **Create Tasks**: Create personal tasks linked to CRD

### Updating Progress
1. **Update Personal Tasklog**: Daily updates in personal tasklog
2. **Update CRD Issue**: Progress in CRD implementation tasks
3. **Update PRD Issue**: Overall feature status
4. **Update Team Summary**: Sprint-level aggregation

### Managing Dependencies
1. **Identify Blockers**: Use GitHub issue dependencies
2. **Update Status**: Reflect blocking relationships
3. **Communicate**: Use issue comments for coordination
4. **Escalate**: Move blocked items to appropriate level

## Status Legend
- ✅ **Completed**: Feature fully implemented and tested
- ⏳ **In Progress**: Active development
- ⏸️ **On Hold**: Temporarily paused
- 📋 **To Do**: Planned but not started
- ❌ **Cancelled**: No longer planned
