Enable multi-user access with proper authentication and role-based permissions.\r\n\r\n## Jobs-to-be-Done\r\n- **System Administrators**: Need to deploy and manage Nucleus in production\r\n- **Security Teams**: Require enterprise-grade security and compliance\r\n- **Operations Teams**: Need monitoring and alerting for system health\r\n- **End Users**: Require secure, reliable access to the system\r\n\r\n## User Journey\r\n1. System admin deploys Nucleus to production environment\r\n2. Security team configures authentication and authorization\r\n3. Operations team sets up monitoring and alerting\r\n4. End users access system with proper authentication\r\n5. System provides reliable, secure service with monitoring\r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\n- [ ] Configure production environment (Docker, Kubernetes, or cloud platform)\r\n- [ ] Implement user authentication and authorization system\r\n- [ ] Set up application monitoring and alerting\r\n- [ ] Configure production security settings\r\n- [ ] Optimize for production load and performance\r\n- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline for automated deployments\r\n- [ ] Configure production database with proper backups\r\n- [ ] Implement logging and error tracking\r\n- [ ] Set up SSL/TLS certificates\r\n- [ ] Configure environment-specific settings\r\n\r\n## Success Criteria\r\n- [ ] System uptime > 99.9%\r\n- [ ] Authentication system supports multiple user types\r\n- [ ] Monitoring alerts trigger for critical issues\r\n- [ ] Security audit passes without major findings\r\n- [ ] Performance meets production load requirements\r\n- [ ] Automated deployments work reliably\r\n\r\n## Dependencies & Risks\r\n- **Dependencies**: Admin Dashboard (#102), Authentication System (#124)\r\n- **Risks**: Production deployment complexity, Security vulnerabilities, Performance bottlenecks\r\n- **Assumptions**: Cloud infrastructure is available, Security requirements are defined\r\n\r\n## Roadmap Priority\r\n- **Priority**: High\r\n- **Timeline**: Phase 4 (Production Deployment)\r\n- **Phase**: Phase 4\r\n\r\n## Implementation Status\r\n- ⏳ **IN PROGRESS**: Production deployment configuration\r\n- ⏳ **IN PROGRESS**: Authentication system setup\r\n- [ ] Configure production environment\r\n- [ ] Set up monitoring and alerting\r\n- [ ] Implement security hardening\r\n- [ ] Configure CI/CD pipeline\r\n\r\n## Related Links\r\n- [CRD: Production Deployment](#123)\r\n- [CRD: Authentication System](#124)\r\n- [Implementation: Production Deployment](#123)\r\n- [Implementation: Authentication System](#124)\r\n\r\n## Labels\r\n- `prd`\r\n- `requirement`\r\n- `product`\r\n- `in-progress`\r\n- `phase-4`\r\n- `production`\r\n- `security` ","createdAt":"2025-07-05T14:28:04Z","labels":[{"id":"LA_kwDOPDCnqM8AAAACEiD8eQ","name":"prd","description":"Product Requirements Document","color":"0366d6"},{"id":"LA_kwDOPDCnqM8AAAACEiEG8g","name":"requirement","description":"Requirement/High-level","color":"0e8a16"},{"id":"LA_kwDOPDCnqM8AAAACEiEHUA","name":"product","description":"Product-level Issue","color":"1d76db"},{"id":"LA_kwDOPDCnqM8AAAACEiEIMA","name":"in-progress","description":"Work In Progress","color":"fbca04"},{"id":"LA_kwDOPDCnqM8AAAACEiFcqg","name":"phase-4","description":"Phase 4","color":"d4c5f9"},{"id":"LA_kwDOPDCnqM8AAAACEiFh-A","name":"production","description":"Production Deployment","color":"e99695"},{"id":"LA_kwDOPDCnqM8AAAACEiFiWQ","name":"security","description":"Security Feature","color":"f9d0c4"}],"number":4,"state":"OPEN","title":"[PRD] Production Deployment","updatedAt":"2025-07-05T14:30:05Z"}
