# ADR-007: CQRS Pattern Implementation

## Status
**Accepted**

## Context
Nucleus needs to handle both write operations (evaluating model outputs) and read operations (retrieving evaluation history) efficiently. The system must maintain clean separation between commands and queries while supporting future extensibility for complex business logic.

Forces at play:
- Need for clear separation between write and read operations
- Requirement for scalable query performance
- Support for complex business logic in write operations
- Integration with MediatR for command/query handling
- Future extensibility for event sourcing
- Team familiarity with CQRS patterns

## Decision
We will implement the CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) pattern in the Application layer using MediatR.

Key aspects of this decision:
- **Commands**: Handle write operations (evaluate model output)
- **Queries**: Handle read operations (get evaluation history)
- **MediatR**: Use MediatR for command/query dispatching
- **Handlers**: Separate handlers for commands and queries
- **Validation**: FluentValidation for command validation
- **Response Objects**: Dedicated response DTOs for queries

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear distinction between read and write operations
- **Scalability**: Can optimize read and write operations independently
- **Maintainability**: Easier to understand and modify business logic
- **Testability**: Commands and queries can be tested in isolation
- **Extensibility**: Easy to add new commands and queries
- **Validation**: Centralized validation for commands
- **Future-Proof**: Foundation for event sourcing and complex workflows

### Negative
- **Complexity**: Additional abstraction layer over direct service calls
- **Learning Curve**: Team must understand CQRS and MediatR patterns
- **Boilerplate**: More classes and interfaces required
- **Performance**: MediatR overhead for simple operations
- **Debugging**: More complex call stack for debugging

### Neutral
- **Structure**: Enforces consistent patterns across the application
- **Documentation**: More explicit about operation intent

## Rationale
CQRS was chosen over alternatives like:
- **Traditional Service Layer**: Less separation, harder to optimize
- **Repository Pattern Only**: Doesn't address business logic complexity
- **Event Sourcing**: Overkill for current requirements
- **Direct Controller Logic**: Would violate clean architecture principles

The decision provides a solid foundation for future growth while maintaining clean architecture principles. MediatR's popularity in the .NET ecosystem ensures good tooling and community support.
