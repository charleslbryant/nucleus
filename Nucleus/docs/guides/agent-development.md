# Agent Development

## Use OpenAI GPTs with Fine-Tuning and Embedding Updates

-   Train base-GPT models on custom datasets to embed domain-specific knowledge and skills.
-   Leverage context embedding with tools like OpenAI's embedding API to enable agents to query dynamic knowledge bases without retraining.
-   Capture structured and unstructured feedback through feedback loops.
-   Integrate external tools such as Microsoft Graph API, HubSpot API, and custom APIs to extend agent functionality.

## Combine GPT Capabilities with Traditional Rule-Based or Deterministic Systems

-   Use business rules to manage repetitive or well-defined tasks.
-   Employ pipeline architectures to allow GPTs to handle creative or interpretive work while deterministic systems using services like Power Automate to manage workflow orchestration.
-   Incorporate task-specific models like Stable Diffusion for design tasks or Hugging Face transformers for niche NLP tasks.

## Deploy Collaborative Multi-Agent Frameworks

-   Create systems where agents with distinct roles collaborate to achieve complex tasks.
    -   Example: A researcher agent gathers information, which a content writer agent summarizes, and a marketing agent utilizes.
-   Use hierarchical management models to centralize task delegation and progress monitoring.

## Leverage Specialized Frameworks

-   Utilize tools like Semantic Kernel to build AI-driven workflows and orchestration.
-   Extend capabilities with frameworks like AutoGen for goal-driven task decomposition and tool interaction.

## Integrate External Knowledge Bases

-   Enable real-time queries of indexed files and documents with vector search solutions like Pinecone or Weaviate.
-   Build and maintain knowledge graphs with tools like Neo4j for structured insights.
-   Integrate APIs to deliver real-time contextual data.

## Incorporate Human-in-the-Loop Training

-   Capture edge cases for additional fine-tuning with active learning.
-   Benchmark response quality and efficiency through evaluation pipelines.
-   Refine contextual cues for various scenarios in prompt engineering workshops.

## Build Domain-Specific Agents

-   **Sales Agents**: Integrate with CRM platforms for personalized interactions.
-   **Marketing Agents**: Use content generation tools and analytics platforms.
-   **Developer Agents**: Leverage coding-specific LLMs and CI/CD pipelines.
-   **Researcher Agents**: Integrate scraping tools and academic query APIs.

## Create Customizable Agent Platforms

-   Develop template-based agents as reusable foundations for specific roles.
-   Offer configuration interfaces for operators to adjust behavior, prompts, and tools.
-   Simplify integration with plug-and-play architectures.

## Host and Scale Agents in Robust Environments

-   Use Kubernetes for modular, scalable deployments.
-   Employ serverless functions for lightweight compute options.
-   Track performance and failures with observability tools.

## Future-Proof Agents with Continual Learning

-   Adapt to evolving needs through dynamic training on anonymized logs.
-   Enable operators to contribute datasets and validate outputs for improvement.
-   Keep models current with scheduled updates.

## AI-Assisted Work

-   Use the OpenAI Assistant Playground as the initial agent training ground where operators can integrate the assistant into their daily work.
-   Create a feedback loop for operators to provide structured and unstructured feedback on agent performance.
-   Allow operators to submit tools and files for integration into the assistant, subject to peer review and approval.
-   Define this stage of the agent lifecycle as AI-Assisted Work, where operators and agents collaboratively train and learn to efficiently produce quality deliverables for completing work items.

These strategies provide the flexibility and control needed to develop specialized agents that meet our operational goals.
