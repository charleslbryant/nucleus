# Product Strategy

## Opportunity

Customers question the authenticity of job photos. There's a need for verifiable proof (time, location, integrity) to reduce disputes and build trust.

## North Star

Deliver indisputable visual proof of job completion via timestamped, geo-tagged, AI-labeled photos.

## OKRs

### Objective 1: Improve customer trust in job documentation

-   KR1: 90% of customers report high confidence in photo authenticity
-   KR2: 80% reduction in disputes related to job photo evidence

### Objective 2: Reduce operational overhead and inefficiencies

-   KR1: 50% fewer follow-up requests for job clarification
-   KR2: 25% cost reduction in job verification efforts

## Initiatives

-   Build Inspector mobile interface to capture trusted job photos with metadata
-   Develop Customer portal to view trusted photo documentation
-   Integrate AI labeling to categorize and describe photos automatically
-   Implement secure, verifiable metadata storage and retrieval plan

# Product Plan

## Milestones

1.  Discovery Complete â€“ Validate user needs, workflows, and technical feasibility
2.  Prototype Built â€“ Basic Inspector and Customer flows demo-ready
3.  MVP Released â€“ Core features launched to pilot users
4.  Feedback Loop â€“ Gather usage data and refine product
5.  Scale & Harden â€“ Security, performance, and expansion features added

## Deliverables

-   Journey maps for Inspectors and Customers
-   Functional prototypes (mobile and web)
-   Verified photo upload module with timestamp, GPS, AI tagging
