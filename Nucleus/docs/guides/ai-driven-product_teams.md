# AI Driven Product Teams

## Building AI-Driven Product Teams

In an **AI-Driven Product** environment, success is rooted in continuous improvement and guided by five core principles:

-   **Clarity** in communication ensures agents and operators understand what to deliver and why.
-   **Strategic and tactical alignment** in task execution connects high-level goals with day-to-day work.
-   **Observability** in performance enables continuous measurement, learning, and improvement.
-   **Explainability** ensures we can interpret and trust deliverables.
-   **Consistency** in deliverables builds client trust and enhances value of deliverables.

The journey for AI-Driven Product Teams progresses through three layers of maturity: **AI-Assisted Coding**, **Agent Development**, and **Agentic Delivery**.

## 1. AI-Assisted Coding

This foundational stage focuses on training both agents and operators. The operator collaborates with their agent assistants by crafting precise prompts to direct workflows, break work items into actionable steps, and improve deliverables.

**Agent Role**

-   Act as specialized junior team members (e.g., marketers, developers, QA analysts, DevOps engineers, data scientists).
-   Execute prompts and produce deliverables for operator review.

**Operator Role**

-   Maintain control over workflows and agent task assignment, ensuring **clarity** in prompts and **alignment** with strategic and tactical goals.
-   Measure performance based on **value-added time** and deliverable ratings, reviews, and scores (e.g., stars, thumbs up/down, percentages).
-   Collaborate with the team to refine and solidify agent training and standard workflows, policies, and templates.

**Goals**

-   Train agents to deliver **high-value deliverables** with consistency and precision.
-   Build confidence in agent outputs by ensuring **explainability** of results and **observability** in performance.
-   Lay the foundation for continuous improvement through feedback and measurable progress.

**Outcome**  
AI-Assisted Coding serves as the training ground, where agents learn and improve while operators refine their ability to prompt, evaluate, and lead agents.

## 2. Agent Development

At this stage, agents gain more autonomy, handling complete work items while maintaining alignment with operator-defined criteria. They focus on delivering **high-value deliverables** efficiently and improving their ratings, reviews, and scores.

**Agent Role**

-   Execute work items independently, adhering to prompts and defined workflows.
-   Strive for explainability in deliverables to build operator trust.
-   Actively improve through operator feedback, targeting higher ratings and better scores.

**Operator Role**

-   Shift from managing tasks to guiding agents and evaluating outcomes.
-   Monitor and analyze performance metrics (e.g., flow time, throughput, and value-added time).
-   Collaborate with the team to optimize workflows, policies, and templates.

**Goals**

-   Deliver predictable, high-value outputs while minimizing operator intervention.
-   Link speed to cost and value, optimizing workflows for value, efficiency, and profitability.
-   Foster a system of continuous improvement based on measurable feedback.

**Outcome**  
Agent Development prepares agents for full autonomy by ensuring they consistently meet or exceed expectations in value, quality, and speed.

## 3. Agentic Delivery

In this stage, agents achieve the **agentic state** with full autonomy. They independently manage work items, delivering **high-value deliverables** aligned with strategic goals, with minimal operator oversight.

**Agent Role**

-   Own the entire lifecycle of a work item, from planning to execution and delivery.
-   Ensure deliverables are explainable and align with strategic and tactical objectives.
-   Continuously improve performance by adapting to feedback and refining workflows.

**Operator Role**

-   Define high-level goals, vision, and success criteria.
-   Monitor performance metrics and provide directional guidance only when necessary.
-   Focus on innovation and strategy while refining policies and templates to scale operations.

**Goals**

-   Achieve consistent, predictable, and explainable high-value deliverables.
-   Scale operations efficiently, reducing reliance on human intervention.
-   Build a self-sustaining system of **Agentic Ops** that continuously improves.

**Outcome**  
Agentic Delivery transforms agents into trusted, autonomous team members capable of delivering measurable value at scale. Operators focus on strategic priorities while agents handle execution.

## Continuous Improvement and Explainability

The path from **AI-Assisted Coding** to **Agentic Delivery** is defined by continuous improvement and explainability. Agents are motivated to enhance their deliverables by earning higher ratings, reviews, and scores, while operators ensure clarity and alignment through refined workflows and templates.

By observing and explaining performance, operators and teams build trust in agent outputs. This system fosters a reliable, scalable process where agents evolve into autonomous contributors, consistently delivering **high-value deliverables** with measurable impact.

This is a lot easier said than done and there is are devils in the details, but this provides a framework to achieve Agentic Ops which we will discuss in another post.
