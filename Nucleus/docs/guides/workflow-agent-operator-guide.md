# Workflow Agent Operator Guide

## Purpose

The Workflow Agent is designed to assist operators in their daily tasks by automating workflows, generating structured documents, and providing strategic alignment. Operators can enhance the agent's functionality by contributing recommendations, resources, and feedback for continuous improvement. Deliverables are the output of agents to fulfill work item requests per requirements. When we create a document, it should be saved, versioned, and aligned and linked to work items.

## How Operators Use the Workflow Agent

### 1. Accessing the Workflow Agent

-   **Web Application**: Use the Workflow Agent via a web-based interface.
-   **Command Line Interface (CLI)**: For developers or technical users, access the agent through the CLI.
-   **API Integration**: Integrate the Workflow Agent with other systems using its API.

### 2. Initiating Tasks

Operators can perform various tasks with the Workflow Agent by selecting pre-configured actions or creating custom workflows.

#### Examples:

-   Generate a product vision document using a predefined template.
-   Automate task prioritization based on project requirements.
-   Query external tools like Microsoft Graph API or HubSpot for data integration.

#### Steps:

1.  **Select Task**: Choose the desired action or workflow from the interface.
2.  **Provide Input**: Enter necessary details (e.g., project name, objectives, or data sources).
3.  **Execute Task**: The agent performs the task and provides results.
4.  **Review Output**: Evaluate the generated content or action.

### 3. Reviewing and Rating Responses

Operators can review the agent's outputs and provide feedback to improve its performance.

#### Steps:

1.  **Rate the Response**:
    1.  Use a rating system (e.g., 1-5 stars) to score the agent's response.
    2.  Provide qualitative feedback in a comment box.
2.  **Mark Issues**:
    1.  Highlight inaccuracies, irrelevant content, or areas needing clarification.
3.  **Submit Feedback**:
    1.  Save the feedback to the agent’s improvement system.

## Contributing to Continuous Improvement

Operators play a crucial role in enhancing the Workflow Agent. Below are ways to contribute:

### 1. Recommending Prompt Changes

-   **Identify Gaps**: Suggest updates to prompts when the agent’s responses are incomplete or inaccurate.
-   **Submit Suggestions**:
    -   Access the "Edit Prompt" feature in the interface.
    -   Provide alternative phrasing or additional context.

### 2. Updating Context Files

-   **Contextual Enhancements**:
    -   Upload new context files (e.g., PDFs, Word documents, spreadsheets).
    -   Link relevant articles, guidelines, or internal documentation.
-   **Version Control**:
    -   Track updates and changes to ensure context files remain relevant.

### 3. Adding Tools and Integrations

-   **Suggest Tools**: Recommend APIs, plugins, or external services for integration.
    -   Example: Adding Asana or Slack integrations.
-   **Testing Tools**: Pilot new integrations and provide feedback on their performance.

### 4. Contributing Links and Media

-   **Upload Files**: Add images, diagrams, or videos to enrich outputs.
-   **Provide References**: Link to authoritative sources or training materials.

### 5. Participating in Reviews and Scoring

-   **Collaborative Reviews**: Work with other operators to validate the agent’s outputs.
-   **Scoring System**:
    -   Evaluate responses for accuracy, relevance, and efficiency.
    -   Submit aggregate scores for performance tracking.

## Advanced Features for Operators

### 1. Creating Custom Workflows

Operators can design workflows tailored to specific tasks or projects.

#### Steps:

1.  **Define Workflow**:
    1.  Select actions (e.g., "Generate Summary," "Send Email").
    2.  Arrange them in sequence.
2.  **Save Workflow**: Name and save the workflow for reuse.
3.  **Execute Workflow**: Provide inputs and run the workflow.

### 2. Accessing Logs and History

-   **Review Logs**:
    -   Access task history to analyze previous actions.
-   **Audit Trail**:
    -   View logs for compliance or troubleshooting.

### 3. Managing Suggestions

Operators can track their suggestions and monitor their impact:

-   **Suggestion Dashboard**: View accepted, pending, or rejected suggestions.
-   **Analytics**: Measure improvement trends based on operator input.

## Best Practices for Operators

### 1. Provide Detailed Feedback

-   Be specific about what worked well and what needs improvement.
-   Use examples to illustrate points clearly.

### 2. Collaborate with Team Members

-   Share insights and discuss improvements collaboratively.
-   Organize feedback sessions to align on critical updates.

### 3. Stay Updated

-   Review release notes and updates for new features.
-   Participate in training sessions to maximize the Workflow Agent’s potential.

## Summary

By leveraging the Workflow Agent’s capabilities and contributing actively to its improvement, operators can optimize their workflows, enhance task efficiency, and ensure the agent evolves to meet organizational needs. Continuous feedback and collaboration are key to achieving these goals. The workflow agent should help make decisions on what to work on by understanding the current context from work items being actively worked on or completed, blocked tasks, and next steps. Calendar events are a meeting work item type and help gauge capacity and free time slots.
