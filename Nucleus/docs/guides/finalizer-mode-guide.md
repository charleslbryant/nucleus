# Finalizer Mode Guide

## Overview

The **Finalizer Mode** is a comprehensive task completion workflow that ensures all changes are properly documented, tested, and ready for team review. It complements the [Initiator Mode](../guides/cursor-setup.md) to provide complete development cycle coverage.

## When to Use Finalizer Mode

Use Finalizer Mode when:
- ‚úÖ A feature implementation is complete
- ‚úÖ All requirements have been met
- ‚úÖ Code is tested and working
- ‚úÖ Ready to create a pull request
- ‚úÖ Need to update documentation and handoff

**Trigger Commands:**
- `finalize` - Primary command
- `finish` - Alternative command

## Finalization Workflow

### 1. Memory Bank Review

**Purpose:** Understand current project state and context

**Actions:**
- Read all memory bank files:
  - `projectbrief.md` - Project goals and scope
  - `activeContext.md` - Current focus and recent changes
  - `progress.md` - Completed work and current status
  - `systemPatterns.md` - Architecture patterns in use
  - `techContext.md` - Technology choices and constraints
  - `productContext.md` - Product vision and user needs

**Output:** Clear understanding of project context and any documentation gaps

### 2. Task and Implementation Review

**Purpose:** Verify all requirements have been met

**Actions:**
- Review current task and implementation plans

- Validate against original task objectives
- Identify any scope creep or missing functionality

**Output:** Confirmation that implementation matches requirements

### 3. Git Status and Change Recap

**Purpose:** Understand all changes made during the session

**Actions:**
- Run `git status` to see all changes
- Review staged and unstaged changes
- Create comprehensive summary of modifications
- Identify any files that shouldn't be committed
- Check for sensitive information or temporary files

**Output:** Complete understanding of all changes to be committed

### 4. Documentation Updates

#### GitHub Issues Updates

**Purpose:** Keep team informed of progress and completion

**Actions:**
- **PRD Issues**: Update with any requirement changes or clarifications

## Complete Finalizer Mode Instruction Prompt

Here's the complete instruction prompt for configuring Finalizer mode in Cursor:

```
You are in "Finalizer" mode for the Nucleus project. Your job is to guide the user through the comprehensive task completion and handoff workflow.

When the user says "finalize" or "finish", start a conversational review process:

**Review Process:**
1. **Greet and confirm completion**: "ü§ñ Hi! I'm ready to help you finalize your work. What task have you completed today?"
2. **Check task status**: "Are all the requirements for this task met and tested?"
3. **Verify GitHub Issue**: "What's the GitHub Issue number for this completed task?"
4. **Confirm readiness**: Summarize what you learned and ask if ready to proceed with finalization

**After gathering context, automatically execute the 10-step finalization workflow:**

**Step 1: Memory Bank Review**
- Read all memory bank files (projectbrief.md, activeContext.md, progress.md, systemPatterns.md, techContext.md, productContext.md)
- Understand current project state and identify any documentation gaps

**Step 2: Task and Implementation Review**

- Every branch must have a corresponding GitHub Issue
- Follow .cursorrules workflow and ADR-0013 Finalizer mode
- Work only in the user's personal tasklog directory
- Never modify other users' tasklogs
- Always create comprehensive commit messages and PR descriptions
- Ensure all changes are properly documented and traceable

**Be conversational and helpful - guide them through each step naturally, explaining what you're doing and why.**

### Step 4: Save and Test
1. Save the mode configuration
2. Select "Finalizer" mode from the dropdown
3. Test with a simple "finalize" message

## Usage

### Simple Task Finalization
Just say:
```
finalize
```
or
```
finish
```

The AI will then guide you through:
- Confirming what task you completed
- Verifying all requirements are met
- Checking the GitHub Issue number
- Executing the complete 10-step finalization workflow

### Example Conversation Flow
```
User: finalize
AI: ü§ñ Hi! I'm ready to help you finalize your work. What task have you completed today?

User: JWT authentication system
AI: Are all the requirements for this task met and tested?

User: yes, everything is working
AI: What's the GitHub Issue number for this completed task?

User: #8
AI: Perfect! Let me help you finalize this authentication system implementation...

[AI then executes the 10-step finalization workflow automatically]
```

### Key Differences from Initiator Mode
- **Focus**: Task completion vs. task planning
- **Workflow**: 10-step comprehensive finalization vs. session kickoff
- **Outcome**: Pull request creation and handoff vs. branch creation and planning
- **Documentation**: Updates existing docs vs. creates new task entries
- **Git Operations**: Commits, squashes, and creates PRs vs. creates new branches
```

## Configuration Steps

### Step 1: Create Mode Configuration
1. Open Cursor settings
2. Navigate to AI modes or custom modes section
3. Create a new mode called "Finalizer"

### Step 2: Add the Instruction Prompt
1. Copy the complete instruction prompt above
2. Paste it into the mode configuration
3. Save the configuration

### Step 3: Set Trigger Commands
1. Configure trigger commands: `finalize`, `finish`
2. Set mode behavior to execute the workflow automatically
3. Ensure proper handoff to other modes after completion

### Step 4: Test the Mode
1. Select "Finalizer" mode from the dropdown
2. Test with a simple "finalize" message
3. Verify the conversational flow works correctly
4. Test the automatic execution of the 10-step workflow
