# Change Request Documents (CRDs)

## Purpose
Change Request Documents (CRDs) break down prioritized PRDs into actionable tasks for implementation. Each CRD is linked to a PRD in the "Now" bucket of the roadmap and defines the work required to deliver the feature.

## Structure
- Each CRD is a standalone markdown file in this directory.
- CRDs are created only for PRDs currently being implemented.
- Each CRD contains a list of tasks, their status, and links to related docs.

## Usage
- Use the CRD template to create new change requests for PRDs in the "Now" bucket.
- Update CRDs as tasks are completed or requirements change.
- Link CRDs to the corresponding PRD and task logs.

## Directory Structure
- `change-requests/` — All CRDs for active PRDs
- `../product-requirements/` — PRDs for all features
- `../tasks/` — Task logs for daily tracking
