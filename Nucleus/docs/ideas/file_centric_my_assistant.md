# File Centric My Assistant

The vision of a file-centric workflow assistant is practical and aligns well with automating the mundane yet essential tracking and documentation tasks. Here's how My Assistant could achieve this, using file monitoring as the backbone for understanding my work:

## Core Functionalities of the File-Centric Assistant

### 1. **Activity Tracking**

-   **File Movement**: Monitor directories (e.g., project folders, repos) for file additions, deletions, updates, and renames.
-   **Change Detection**:
    -   Detect content changes in documents, code, and configurations.
    -   Track file size, metadata, and timestamps for activity analysis.
-   **Work Item Association**:
    -   Infer related work items by mapping file paths or tags to tasks in your work item queue.

### 2. **Work Automation**

-   **Auto-Documentation**:
    -   Generate logs of edits, commits, or configurations based on file changes.
    -   Automatically attach these logs to related work items or projects.
-   **Process Mapping**:
    -   Identify workflows from repeated patterns (e.g., coding, testing, deploying).
    -   Recommend optimizations or automation opportunities.

### 3. **Meeting and Collaboration Integration**

-   **Meeting Prep**:
    -   Watch for opened or edited files related to upcoming meetings (e.g., presentation slides, agenda docs).
    -   Summarize changes or compile key discussion points.
-   **Post-Meeting Action**:
    -   Extract action items and decisions from meeting summaries.
    -   Map action items to relevant files and create follow-up tasks.

### 4. **Task and Workflow Management**

-   **Implicit Logging**:
    -   Replace manual time logging with automatic recording of time spent on files.
    -   Track focus shifts between files for better workflow insights.
-   **Workflow Optimization**:
    -   Identify bottlenecks by analyzing "aging" files or unfinished tasks.
    -   Suggest next steps or reprioritizations based on file activity patterns.

## Technical Approach

### 1. **File Monitoring**

-   Use file watchers (e.g., FileSystemWatcher in .NET) to detect file events.
-   Log metadata like path, type, size, timestamps, and content hashes.

### 2. **Activity Correlation**

-   Map file changes to work items:
    -   **Direct mapping**: Use file naming conventions, tags, or metadata.
    -   **Contextual mapping**: Infer connections from calendar events, meeting notes, or prior work sessions.

### 3. **Data Serialization**

-   Serialize work states (code, configs, documents) to versioned files.
-   Maintain a lightweight metadata store to track relationships between files and tasks.

### 4. **Real-Time Analytics**

-   Run periodic scans or real-time analysis to:
    -   Predict overdue tasks.
    -   Highlight impactful changes.
    -   Suggest prioritization.

### 5. **AI-Driven Insights**

-   Use machine learning or rule-based systems to:
    -   Identify recurring patterns in your workflows.
    -   Provide actionable insights for improvement.

## End-of-Day Summary

-   A report based on your file activity, including:
    -   Tasks implicitly completed (based on file changes).
    -   Open files or tasks that need attention.
    -   Workflow metrics like time spent, interruptions, or productivity peaks.

## How It Feels to Use

-   **Seamless**: You don't have to log anything explicitly.
-   **Integrated**: It ties into your existing tools and processes.
-   **Insightful**: You receive actionable recommendations and analytics, freeing you to focus on creative and strategic work.
