# Workflow Assistant

## Vision

Your workflow assistant is a proactive, file-centric companion that automates the tracking, reporting, and optimization of your daily tasks. It integrates seamlessly with your tools, observes your activities through file changes, and eliminates the need for manual updates, task movement, or time logging.

The assistant helps you:

1.  Plan your workday by analyzing tasks, meetings, and priorities.
2.  Track your progress automatically based on file activities.
3.  Provide insights and reports without interrupting your workflow.
4.  Optimize your processes by identifying patterns and suggesting improvements.

## High-Level Requirements

### 1. Monitoring and Awareness

-   **File-Centric**:
    -   Watch directories and repositories for file changes (creation, updates, deletions).
    -   Extract metadata (name, type, location, timestamps, version history).
    -   Analyze file content where appropriate (e.g., diffs for code, summaries for documents).
-   **Integrated Context**:
    -   Monitor your calendar and emails for meeting and task context.
    -   Recognize work item queues from tools like Teamwork, Jira, or Azure DevOps.
    -   Associate files with relevant tasks, meetings, or projects automatically.

### 2. Automation

-   **Implicit Task Management**:
    -   Automatically log time spent on files and associate it with tasks.
    -   Detect progress on tasks based on file modifications.
    -   Generate updates for task status (e.g., "in progress," "completed").
-   **Process Automation**:
    -   Auto-generate summaries, notes, or reports for meetings and work sessions.
    -   Automatically archive completed files and organize directories.

### 3. Reporting and Insights

-   **Daily Reports**:
    -   Summarize completed work, ongoing tasks, and blockers.
    -   Include insights on time spent, productivity patterns, and meeting outcomes.
-   **Real-Time Notifications**:
    -   Alert you to bottlenecks, aging files, or overdue tasks.
    -   Recommend next steps or reprioritize tasks based on current progress.

### 4. Workflow Optimization

-   **Pattern Recognition**:
    -   Learn from your habits to suggest workflow improvements.
    -   Identify repetitive actions that can be automated (e.g., creating boilerplate files).
-   **Feedback Loops**:
    -   Provide suggestions to improve focus, reduce interruptions, or align with priorities.

## Specific Features

### Task Awareness

-   Map tasks to files through naming conventions, metadata, or contextual inference.
-   Detect when tasks are completed based on file movements or edits.

### Meeting Integration

-   Prepare files or summaries for scheduled meetings.
-   Log meeting outcomes, decisions, and action items into relevant tasks or repositories.

### File Management

-   Maintain version histories for files.
-   Track relationships between files, tasks, and projects.

### Integration with Tools

-   Calendar (e.g., Outlook, Google Calendar).
-   File Repositories (e.g., GitHub, SharePoint, local folders).
-   Work Item Management (e.g., Teamwork, Azure DevOps, Jira).

## Technical Requirements

### 1. File Monitoring

-   **Mechanism**: Use file watchers (e.g., FileSystemWatcher in .NET) to monitor changes.
-   **Storage**: Maintain a lightweight database to log file activity and metadata.
-   **Search**: Enable fast queries to retrieve associated tasks, notes, or histories.

### 2. Context Processing

-   Natural Language Processing (NLP) to extract context from meetings, emails, or file content.
-   Rules-based or machine learning models to infer relationships between activities.

### 3. User Interface

-   Conversational interface (chat or voice) for daily planning and reporting.
-   Dashboard for detailed task and workflow insights.

### 4. Scalability

-   Deploy as a local or cloud service, with options for:
    -   Real-time monitoring.
    -   Batch processing for historical analysis.

## Expected Benefits

-   **Efficiency**: Eliminate manual updates, logging, and task tracking.
-   **Focus**: Spend more time on high-value tasks and less on workflow overhead.
-   **Insights**: Gain actionable knowledge about productivity and processes.
