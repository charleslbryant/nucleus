# Task Automation Feature

To effectively develop the **Task Automation** feature for the Workflow Agent, here are the **user stories** categorized by their development stages and priorities:

## Core Functionality Stories

1.  **Basic Workflow Execution**
    1.  *As an operator,* I want to select predefined workflows so that I can automate repetitive tasks without manual effort.
    2.  *Acceptance Criteria:*
        1.  Operators can view a list of available workflows.
        2.  Operators can execute a selected workflow with a single click.
2.  **Input-Driven Task Execution**
    1.  *As an operator,* I want to provide necessary input parameters for workflows so that the tasks are executed accurately.
    2.  *Acceptance Criteria:*
        1.  Inputs can be entered through a form or predefined templates.
        2.  The system validates inputs before execution.
3.  **Task Status Monitoring**
    1.  *As an operator,* I want to monitor the status of running workflows so that I can track progress and address issues if they arise.
    2.  *Acceptance Criteria:*
        1.  Real-time status updates (e.g., Pending, Running, Completed, Failed).
        2.  Visual indicators for task progress.

## Workflow Creation and Management Stories

1.  **Custom Workflow Design**
    1.  *As an operator,* I want to create and save custom workflows so that I can automate complex, multi-step tasks.
    2.  *Acceptance Criteria:*
        1.  Operators can define workflows by combining predefined actions.
        2.  Custom workflows can be saved for future use.
2.  **Workflow Editing**
    1.  *As an operator,* I want to modify existing workflows so that I can adjust to changing requirements.
    2.  *Acceptance Criteria:*
        1.  Operators can add, remove, or rearrange steps in a workflow.
        2.  Version control is maintained for changes.
3.  **Workflow Execution History**
    1.  *As an operator,* I want to view the history of executed workflows so that I can analyze past actions and results.
    2.  *Acceptance Criteria:*
        1.  Logs include workflow name, execution time, status, and outputs.
        2.  Search and filter functionality for workflow logs.

## Task Orchestration and Efficiency Stories

1.  **Parallel Task Execution**
    1.  *As an operator,* I want the agent to execute tasks in parallel where possible so that workflows complete faster.
    2.  *Acceptance Criteria:*
        1.  Parallel tasks are identified and executed without conflicts.
        2.  Operators can view dependencies and parallel execution paths.
2.  **Error Handling and Retry Mechanism**
    1.  *As an operator,* I want the agent to handle errors and allow retries for failed tasks so that workflows are reliable.
    2.  *Acceptance Criteria:*
        1.  Errors are logged with clear messages.
        2.  Failed tasks can be retried manually or automatically.
3.  **Conditional Workflow Logic**
    1.  *As an operator,* I want to define conditional logic in workflows so that tasks adapt dynamically based on outcomes.
    2.  *Acceptance Criteria:*
        1.  Operators can define if-then conditions for workflow steps.
        2.  Workflows adjust execution paths based on defined conditions.

## Integration and Extensibility Stories

1.  **API Integration for Workflows**
    1.  *As a developer,* I want to integrate external APIs into workflows so that the agent can connect with other systems.
    2.  *Acceptance Criteria:*
        1.  Operators can configure API calls as workflow steps.
        2.  API responses are logged and used in subsequent steps.
2.  **Plugin-Based Task Extensions**
    1.  *As a developer,* I want to add custom plugins to extend workflow capabilities so that the agent meets unique needs.
    2.  *Acceptance Criteria:*
        1.  Plugin architecture supports easy integration.
        2.  Plugins can be enabled or disabled dynamically.

## Operator Experience Stories

1.  **User-Friendly Workflow Interface**
    1.  *As an operator,* I want an intuitive interface to interact with workflows so that I can easily manage tasks.
    2.  *Acceptance Criteria:*
        1.  Clear navigation and visual indicators for workflow steps.
        2.  Drag-and-drop functionality for building workflows.
2.  **Predefined Workflow Templates**
    1.  *As an operator,* I want to access predefined templates for common workflows so that I can save time in setup.
    2.  *Acceptance Criteria:*
        1.  Templates are available for common tasks (e.g., document generation, prioritization).
        2.  Templates can be customized before execution.
3.  **Notifications and Alerts**
    1.  *As an operator,* I want to receive notifications for workflow events (e.g., completion, errors) so that I stay informed.
    2.  *Acceptance Criteria:*
        1.  Notifications are configurable (e.g., email, in-app alerts).
        2.  Alerts include detailed information about workflow events.
