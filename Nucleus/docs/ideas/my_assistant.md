# My Assistant

## Morning Planning

1.  **Daily Prioritization**: The assistant pulls your work item queue and calendar for the day. It suggests priorities based on:
    1.  Due dates
    2.  Revenue impact
    3.  Strategic alignment
    4.  Work in progress limits
2.  **Work Plan**:
    1.  Propose a time-blocked schedule for the day.
    2.  Reserve focus time for deep work and breaks.
    3.  Suggest meetings to prepare for or cancel (based on alignment with goals).

## During the Day

1.  **Task Updates**:
    1.  Track progress on work items.
    2.  Log notes, time spent, and completed work for each item.
    3.  Alert you when tasks or deadlines risk slipping.
2.  **Ad-Hoc Requests**:
    1.  Dynamically add, re-prioritize, or delegate work items.
    2.  Fetch or update documents in your file repo related to tasks.
3.  **Collaboration**:
    1.  Join meetings and summarize key points and action items.
    2.  Monitor chats or emails for updates that might impact your work queue.
4.  **Notifications**:
    1.  Reminders for meetings, deadlines, or status updates.
    2.  Alerts for dependencies, blockers, or unexpected work queue changes.

## End of Day Reporting

1.  **Summary Report**:
    1.  Review completed work items.
    2.  Log progress against goals (e.g., sprint or project targets).
    3.  Identify carryovers and revise priorities for tomorrow.
2.  **Reflection**:
    1.  Ask for feedback on the day’s flow.
    2.  Highlight bottlenecks or inefficiencies and propose improvements.
3.  **Preparation for Tomorrow**:
    1.  Propose tomorrow’s schedule and tasks based on incomplete work, upcoming deadlines, and your availability.

## Implementation Suggestions

1.  **Work Item Queue**:
    1.  Integrate with your task/project management system (e.g., Teamwork, Azure DevOps, Jira).
    2.  Allow your assistant to dynamically prioritize tasks based on a mix of manual and automated rules.
2.  **Calendar**:
    1.  Sync with Outlook/Google Calendar.
    2.  Enable bi-directional updates (e.g., schedule blocks for deep work or adjust based on meeting cancellations).
3.  **File Repo**:
    1.  Connect to your file repository (e.g., GitHub, SharePoint).
    2.  Implement file management commands (e.g., “fetch task docs” or “archive completed work”).
4.  **Conversational Flow**:
    1.  Use a conversational UI (chat interface or voice commands) to maintain flexibility and focus.
