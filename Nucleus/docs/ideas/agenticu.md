AgenticU

I want to build a learning community named AgenticU as part of AgenticOps. First, this will be a source of knowledge on AgenticOps and related concepts. It will also contain a concept gallery that provides details on AgenticOps concepts. For example, throughput is a performance indicator in AgenticOps. We can have a page on performance indicators and one on throughput. Each page would define what it is, why it matters. Because throughput is a metric, it also defines the target range, what it impacts, and how AgenticOps helps.
