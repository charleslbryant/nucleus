# Large Language Model Papers

Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have gained prominence in recent years, especially with the rise of OpenAI's GPT models, Google's Bard, and other advanced LLMs. Below are some **seminal papers** that have shaped the development of **LLM-based agents**:

## 1. Foundational Papers on LLMs

-   **Vaswani et al. (2017) - Attention Is All You Need**
    -   Introduced the **Transformer architecture**, which underpins modern LLMs like GPT, BERT, and T5. This paper is arguably the most influential in modern NLP.
-   **Radford et al. (2018) - Improving Language Understanding by Generative Pre-Training**
    -   Introduced **GPT-1**, showing that pre-trained generative models can achieve strong NLP results with fine-tuning.
-   **Brown et al. (2020) - Language Models are Few-Shot Learners (GPT-3)**
    -   Introduced **GPT-3**, showing that large-scale language models can perform NLP tasks with minimal fine-tuning, paving the way for LLM-based agents.
-   **Touvron et al. (2023) - LLaMA: Open and Efficient Foundation Language Models**
    -   Introduced **LLaMA**, showing that smaller, well-trained models can rival the performance of massive LLMs.

## 2. LLMs as Autonomous Agents

-   **Andrej Karpathy (2023) - State of GPT: Agentic Capabilities in Language Models**
    -   Discusses how **LLMs evolve into general-purpose agents**, covering reasoning, memory, and interaction.
-   **OpenAI (2023) - GPT-4 Technical Report**
    -   Describes **GPT-4's multimodal capabilities**, which are crucial for developing **multi-agent LLM systems**.
-   **Yao et al. (2022) - ReAct: Synergizing Reasoning and Acting in Language Models**
    -   Introduces **ReAct**, where LLMs use reasoning and action-taking to enhance agentic capabilities.
-   **Shinn et al. (2023) - Reflexion: Language Agents with Verbal Reinforcement Learning**
    -   Introduces **Reflexion**, a framework where LLMs can **self-reflect** and improve their performance dynamically.
-   **LangChain (2023) - LangChain: Building Applications with LLMs**
    -   Describes the **LangChain** framework, which enables **LLM-based agents** to perform **tool use, planning, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)**.
-   **Hugging Face & Google DeepMind (2023) - Toolformer: Language Models Can Teach Themselves to Use Tools**
    -   Introduces **Toolformer**, an LLM that autonomously learns how to use external APIs and tools.

## 3. Multi-Agent Systems and LLM Coordination

-   **Park et al. (2023) - Generative Agents: Interactive Simulacra of Human Behavior**
    -   **One of the most influential papers** on **multi-agent LLM environments**, where agents **remember, reflect, and plan** dynamically.
-   **Liang et al. (2023) - Autonomous LLM Agents for Code Generation and Debugging**
    -   Explores how LLMs can function as **AI software engineers**, iterating on code development and debugging tasks.
-   **Schick et al. (2023) - Toolformer: Enabling Language Models to Use External APIs for Reasoning**
    -   Shows how LLMs can **invoke external tools**, making them **more powerful as autonomous agents**.
-   **Wu et al. (2023) - MetaGPT: Meta-Learning for Language Model Agents**
    -   Explores how **LLMs can improve their reasoning and task execution over time**, rather than relying only on static pretraining.

## 4. LLM Agents in Real-World Applications

-   **AutoGPT & BabyAGI (2023) - Autonomous GPT Agents for Task Execution**
    -   Open-source implementations that allow **LLMs to autonomously break down and execute complex tasks**.
-   **DeepMind (2023) - GATO: A Generalist Agent**
    -   Shows that a **single LLM-powered agent** can perform multiple unrelated tasks across different domains.
-   **Google DeepMind (2023) - AlphaCode: Competitive Programming with LLMs**
    -   Demonstrates how **LLMs can function as autonomous problem-solving agents** in competitive programming.

## 5. LLMs and Memory for Agentic Behavior

-   **Sun et al. (2023) - Memory in LLM Agents: Storing and Retrieving Information Efficiently**
    -   Discusses how **LLMs can retain long-term memory**, a key limitation in autonomous agent applications.
-   **Google DeepMind (2023) - LLM Agents with Episodic and Semantic Memory**
    -   Explores **long-term planning, recall, and self-improvement in AI agents**.
