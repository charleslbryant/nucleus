# Performance Indicators

Performance indicators are how we measure the performance of a workflow. Here’s how we can refine the **Metrics Section** of the Workflow Assistant’s requirements to include these critical metrics. These metrics will provide insight into your workflow and help optimize productivity and efficiency.

## Metrics and Analytics

The Workflow Assistant will monitor and report on the following key performance metrics to help you evaluate and optimize your workflows:

### **1. Cycle Time**

-   **Definition**: The time it takes for a work item to move from the "In Progress" state to completion.
-   **Purpose**: Measures the efficiency of task execution and highlights bottlenecks in the process.
-   **How Tracked**:
    -   Automatically starts when the assistant detects activity on a task or file.
    -   Ends when the task is marked complete or no further activity is detected.

### **2. Lead Time**

-   **Definition**: The total time from when a work item is created to when it is completed.
-   **Purpose**: Assesses how quickly tasks are addressed and delivered from initiation to completion.
-   **How Tracked**:
    -   Starts when a task is added to the queue or flagged via email or meeting notes.
    -   Ends when the task is completed and documented.

### **3. Throughput**

-   **Definition**: The number of work items completed in a given time period.
-   **Purpose**: Measures overall productivity and helps evaluate team or individual capacity.
-   **How Tracked**:
    -   Counts all completed work items (e.g., files edited, tasks closed) in daily, weekly, or monthly intervals.

### **4. Work in Progress (WIP)**

-   **Definition**: The number of work items actively being worked on at any given time.
-   **Purpose**: Monitors workload and helps prevent overloading, maintaining a smooth workflow.
-   **How Tracked**:
    -   Continuously updated based on active tasks and file changes.

### **5. Quality Ratio**

-   **Definition**: The ratio of successful or completed work items to total work items, including rejected or revised items.
-   **Purpose**: Measures the quality and accuracy of delivered work.
-   **How Tracked**:
    -   Compares completed tasks with those flagged for rework, defects, or issues during reviews.

### **6. Flow Balance**

-   **Definition**: The balance between work entering and exiting the system over time.
-   **Purpose**: Ensures a steady flow of work without overloading the system or creating bottlenecks.
-   **How Tracked**:
    -   Analyzes trends in task creation, progress, and completion rates.

### **7. Value-Added Time**

-   **Definition**: The time spent directly contributing to the completion of a work item, excluding waiting or idle time.
-   **Purpose**: Measures how effectively time is used on productive activities.
-   **How Tracked**:
    -   Uses file activity logs to differentiate between active work periods and idle or blocked time.

### **8. Work Item Aging**

-   **Definition**: The time elapsed since a work item was created or moved to a specific state.
-   **Purpose**: Highlights tasks at risk of becoming overdue or stuck in progress.
-   **How Tracked**:
    -   Monitors time spent in each state (e.g., "To Do," "In Progress," "Blocked").

## How Metrics Are Used

1.  **Daily Reporting**:
    1.  Provide a summary of key metrics (e.g., cycle time, throughput) to give a clear view of daily productivity.
2.  **Trend Analysis**:
    1.  Identify patterns over time to predict workload issues or optimize workflows.
3.  **Bottleneck Detection**:
    1.  Highlight aging work items, stalled tasks, or imbalanced flow to proactively address issues.
4.  **Optimization Suggestions**:
    1.  Use metrics to recommend actions, such as breaking down large tasks, reallocating resources, or setting WIP limits.

## Visualization and Insights

The Workflow Assistant will offer the following visual and data representations:

-   **Charts** for cycle time, lead time, and throughput trends.
-   **Heatmaps** to show aging tasks and bottlenecks.
-   **Dashboards** summarizing WIP, flow balance, and value-added time.
-   **Alerts** for outliers or deviations from expected performance (e.g., tasks exceeding cycle time limits).

## Implementation Considerations

1.  **Data Collection**:
    1.  Leverage file activity logs, Microsoft Graph events, and task management system data to calculate metrics.
2.  **Data Storage**:
    1.  Maintain a lightweight database for historical metric tracking and analysis.
3.  **Real-Time Processing**:
    1.  Provide live updates for metrics like WIP and flow balance.
4.  **User Customization**:
    1.  Allow you to adjust thresholds for alerts or focus on specific metrics based on your workflow priorities.
