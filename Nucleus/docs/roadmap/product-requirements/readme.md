# Product Requirement Documents (PRDs)

## Purpose
Product Requirement Documents (PRDs) define the requirements, user problems, and jobs-to-be-done for each feature in a product. Each PRD describes a feature that delivers value by solving a user pain point or fulfilling a need along a user journey.

## Structure
- Each PRD is a standalone markdown file in this directory.
- PRDs are numbered sequentially with 4 digits (PRD-0001, PRD-0002, etc.).
- Each PRD follows a consistent template format.
- PRDs are immutable once accepted - new requirements create new PRDs.

## Usage
- Use the PRD template to create new feature requirements.
- Update PRDs as requirements evolve.
- Link PRDs to the roadmap for prioritization and to CRDs for implementation planning.

## Directory Structure
- `product-requirements/` — All PRDs for product features
- `../roadmap.md` — Roadmap with prioritized PRDs
- `../change-requests/` — CRDs for PRDs in active development
