# Product Vision Documents

Here is a standard part of my workflow for product management. When I need to work on a product, after I understand user needs, journeys, and how to deliver value to users, I create or update a product vision document to define what the product is and why we are delivering it. It also outlays the north star, OKRs, top-level work items, and hypothesis.

That's a solid and structured approach for product management. Establishing a **product vision document** as the foundation ensures clarity, alignment, and purpose throughout the product lifecycle. It also sets a clear direction for stakeholders and teams.

## Workflow for Product Vision Documents

### Purpose of the Vision Document

1.  **Define the Product**: Clearly articulate what the product is, its purpose, and its target audience.
2.  **North Star**: Establish the overarching goal or mission that guides the product's development.
3.  **OKRs**: Provide measurable objectives and key results to ensure progress aligns with strategic goals.
4.  **Top-Level Work Items**: Outline high-level epics, features, or initiatives that need to be delivered.
5.  **Hypotheses**: State testable assumptions about user needs, value delivery, and product impact.

## Components of a Vision Document

### 1. Product Overview

-   **What**: Define the product in a single sentence (e.g., "The Workflow Assistant is a file-centric AI companion for professionals managing complex workflows.").
-   **Why**: Explain the user problem it solves and the value it delivers.

### 2. North Star

-   **Definition**: A clear, aspirational statement of the long-term impact of the product.
    -   Example: "Empower professionals to focus on high-value work by automating repetitive tasks and providing actionable insights."

### 3. Objectives and Key Results (OKRs)

-   **Objectives**: Broad, qualitative goals the product aims to achieve.
-   **Key Results**: Specific, measurable outcomes that indicate progress toward the objectives.

**Example OKRs**:

-   **Objective**: Improve user productivity.
    -   **Key Result**: Reduce task management time by 50%.
    -   **Key Result**: Achieve 90% user satisfaction with daily reports.
-   **Objective**: Enhance workflow efficiency.
    -   **Key Result**: Decrease average task cycle time by 30%.
    -   **Key Result**: Identify and resolve 95% of workflow bottlenecks within 24 hours.

### 4. Top-Level Work Items

-   **Epics**: High-level deliverables that break down into smaller work items.
    -   Example:
        -   Epic 1: Build core file monitoring and task automation.
        -   Epic 2: Integrate with Microsoft 365 for email, calendar, and task management.
        -   Epic 3: Provide actionable workflow insights and recommendations.

### 5. Hypotheses

-   State testable assumptions about:
    -   **User Needs**: "Users need a way to track and manage tasks without manual input."
    -   **Value Delivery**: "Automating workflow tracking will save users at least 5 hours per week."
    -   **Impact**: "Proactive insights will improve task prioritization and reduce missed deadlines by 20%."

### 6. Success Metrics

-   Identify measurable indicators of product success.
    -   Example:
        -   Engagement Metrics: Daily active users, feature adoption rates.
        -   Productivity Metrics: Time saved, reduction in cycle time.
        -   Quality Metrics: User satisfaction score, reduction in errors.

## How It Fits into Your Workflow

1.  **Start with Discovery**:
    1.  Understand the user's journey, problems, and goals.
    2.  Define the value the product delivers and the job-to-be-done.
2.  **Draft/Update the Vision Document**:
    1.  Formalize insights from discovery into a clear and actionable vision.
    2.  Share and align with stakeholders to ensure buy-in.
3.  **Define and Prioritize Work**:
    1.  Use the vision document as the foundation for backlog creation, prioritization, and roadmap planning.
4.  **Iterate on the Vision**:
    1.  Periodically update the vision document to reflect learnings from user feedback and market changes.
