# Product Roadmap

## Purpose
The roadmap organizes and prioritizes all Product Requirement Documents (PRDs). It provides a clear, time-bucketed plan for delivering value to users by grouping features into "Now", "Next", and "Future" buckets.

## Structure
- The roadmap is a single markdown file in this directory.
- PRDs are referenced and prioritized in the roadmap.
- Each PRD in the "Now" bucket will have an associated Change Request Document (CRD) for implementation planning.

## Usage
- Update the roadmap as priorities change.
- Move PRDs between buckets as the product evolves.
- Use the roadmap to guide sprint and release planning.

## Buckets
- **Now**: Features currently being implemented (with CRDs)
- **Next**: Features to be implemented after "Now"
- **Future**: Features under consideration for later development
