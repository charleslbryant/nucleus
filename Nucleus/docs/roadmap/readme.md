# Product Roadmap

## Purpose
The roadmap organizes and prioritizes all Product Requirement Documents (PRDs) and Change Request Documents (CRDs) using GitHub Issues. It provides a clear, time-bucketed plan for delivering value to users by grouping features into "Now", "Next", and "Future" buckets, all managed through GitHub Issues and labels.

## Structure
- The roadmap is managed through GitHub Issues using labels and milestones.
- PRDs are GitHub Issues with the `prd` label and are prioritized using `phase-1`, `phase-2`, `phase-3`, `phase-4` labels.
- Each PRD in the "Now" bucket will have an associated CRD (GitHub Issue with `crd` and `epic` labels) for implementation planning.
- The [Traceability Matrix](../github-issues/traceability-matrix.md) shows the full relationship between PRDs, CRDs, and tasks.

## Usage
- Update priorities by editing issue labels, milestones, or project boards in GitHub.
- Move PRDs between buckets by changing their phase label.
- Use the roadmap and issues to guide sprint and release planning.
- Reference the [Team Collaboration Guide](../tasks/team-collaboration-guide.md) for workflow details.

## Buckets (via Labels)
- **Now**: Features currently being implemented (`phase-1`)
- **Next**: Features to be implemented after "Now" (`phase-2`)
- **Future**: Features under consideration for later development (`phase-3`, `phase-4`)

## Where to Find Things
- **PRDs**: [GitHub Issues with `prd` label](https://github.com/charleslbryant/nucleus/issues?q=label%3Aprd)
- **CRDs**: [GitHub Issues with `crd` label](https://github.com/charleslbryant/nucleus/issues?q=label%3Acrd)
- **Traceability Matrix**: [docs/github-issues/traceability-matrix.md](../github-issues/traceability-matrix.md)
- **Team Collaboration Guide**: [docs/tasks/team-collaboration-guide.md](../tasks/team-collaboration-guide.md)
- **Legacy PRDs/CRDs**: Archived in [docs/archive/legacy-docs/](../archive/legacy-docs/)

## Migration Note
- As of July 2025, all PRDs and CRDs are managed through GitHub Issues. The previous markdown files are archived for reference only.
